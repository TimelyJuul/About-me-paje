    <h1>More About Me</h1>
      <p> I used to have horrible grades in school until i found a spark of joy in my life. Its imporant to surround yourself with people that you love.</p>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
      <p>One hobby I used to do was <strong>soccer</strong>. I was good at soccer until Covid-19 hit us. It made playing soccer so hard because my parents didnt want to  leave the house. Now i mostly focus on videogames. I like to hangout with my friends too from time to time.

    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>A professional turtle racer. Just kidding, I would love to be a full-time <strong>creative</strong> who's given an array of responsibilities in front-end work, photography, design, and whatever else comes my way.</p>

    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>My husband and I recently roadtripped through Arizona listening to the band <a href="http://houndmouth.com/">Houdmouth</a>. I don't know what it is about them, but they make you want to keep driving and driving. Start with the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8wifV5RYr8">"Sedona"</a> first.</p>
